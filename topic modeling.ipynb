        "From the result above, we can see score2 has the best performance. While we comparing scores with negated scores, in this case, there is no difference, that is because few negated word is detected (at most one negated word in each comments, and most of the comments have no negated words), so the influence is too slight to be observed. In practical, I think negated process makes the result more accurate, while it consumes more time. It is hard to draw a conclusion whether score2 performs better than score3, because using score3, it has only one less \"buy\" than score2, which could be easily affected by the quality, volume of the dataset."

So I guess the best parameter could be a little larger than I used to set. To verify whether my guessing, in the second grid search, I tuned the parameters a little bigger. From above we can see, the learning rate keeps at 0.2, the max_depth keeps at 7, which shows they are likely to be the best or local best, as for n_estimators, it seems that it can still go bigger.

        "In this question, I used tf-idf as input text vectors. While I was setting the number of max_features, firstly I followed the sample code (max_features=1000), then I tried using all features to see which one is better. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, I also attempted to remove some useless key words, I regard those key words that appeared in more than half of the  topics (I defined 'appear' as a word is in the top 15 of a topic's key words.) as useless key words because if most topic contains those words, that means it have few contribution helping with recognizing the topic. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, I have tried two random_states of LDA model, my research is based on the random_state=42(**Table 1**), but finally, because the performance of random_state=88 is better, I kept the result of randoms_state=88(**Table 2**).\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let's take a look at the summary table above.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can see while we use 3 topics, the precision is higher than 10 topics, that is because while we have 10 topics, some topics may close to other topics. If we only have 3 topics, it is much harder to give the wrong label as there is only limited but various labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "In both 3 and 10 topics modeling, when we only use limited features, the precision is much better. That is because if we only need to build these topics, 1000 features is enough, the less important features may perform like noise, as a result, they have some sort of negative effect on the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Does remove the useless key words help? My answer is \"When the precision is not good enough, removing key words is helpful to some extend(See line 5 and line 6 of **Table 1**). However, if the performance is good enough, then it doesn' help much(See line 1 and line 2 of **Table 1**), and it can even make negative contribution since the original performance is very good(See line 1 and line 2, line 5 and line 6 of **Table 2**)\". \n",
        "\n",
        "We can see, in the 3-topic modeling, remove the useless keywords does not help. The reason is that the original precision is good enough in 3-topic modeling, it is hard to improve via simply removing some keywords, most of the documents have been labeled correctly, the wrong labled documents themselves may be harder to be classified. And for some documents, if we remove some of the keywords, then it may lose some features, then be misclassified. However, for the 10-topic modeling, it has more topics, so the result is more sensitive to the accuracy of the topic description, or in other words, they need the key words to be more identifiable, removing those common keywords does help, especially when the original precision is not good enough(line 5 and line 6 of **Table 1**). Additionally, the my method of selecting useless keywords may need to be improved, the quality of the useless keywords may have some infulence.\n",

I checked the data of **Table 1**, and found that in these cases, most documents are allocated to one topic, that makes such a strange phenomenon happen. My deduction is that those extreme topic contains many common and frequent words. For example, let's take look at the classification result of line7 of **Table 1**:\n",
